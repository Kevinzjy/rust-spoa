# rust-spoa

This crate is a Rust wrapper and interface to the [SPOA](https://github.com/rvaser/spoa) (simd-accelerated partial order alignment) library.
This library allows the efficient generation of a consensus sequence from a set of DNA or protein sequences.

If you use this crate, please cite the original authors of SPOA:
